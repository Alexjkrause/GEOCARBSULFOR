# GEOCARBSULFOR
Code and data files for variations of the GEOCARBSULFOR model in MATLAB.

- GEOCARBSULFOR is the original model (Krause et al., 2018 in Nature Communications). 

- GEOCARBSULFOR_MC is a Monte Carlo approach which includes some updates to the data used, and takes into account some uncertainties. See the README within the zip file for more information, as well as the extensive comments within the code. This code is for a paper currently in production at Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The results (named outputs) of this model can be found separately in the GCBS4_outputs_14_7_2022.zip file
