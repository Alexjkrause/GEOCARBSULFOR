# GEOCARBSULFOR
Code and data files for variations of the GEOCARBSULFOR model in MATLAB.

- GEOCARBSULFOR is the original model (Krause et al., 2018 in Nature Communications). 

- GEOCARBSULFOR_MC is a Monte Carlo approach which includes some updates to the data used, and takes into account some uncertainties. See the README within the zip file for more information, as well as the extensive comments within the code. This code is for a review paper on atmospheric oxygen during the Phanerozoic (2023, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences). The results (named outputs) of this model can be found separately in the GCBS4_outputs_14_7_2022.zip file

- GEOCARBSULFOR_SO4concs is a Monte Carlo approach but the normalised calcium forcing, which is used to partially determine gypsum burial, has been updated, as well as some other minor things. This is for the paper: Modelling sulfate concentrations in the global ocean through Phanerozoic time by Krause et al. which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of the Geological Society of London (March 2024) and is the most recent iteration of the model. The same version is available from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10814777"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10814777.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

- The Krause_etal_Supp_Final.pdf file contains the main equations for the model (2018 version), and will be updated when I have a spare moment, to reflect some of the minor changes incorporated for the 2023 AREPS version.
