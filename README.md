# GEOCARBSULFOR
Code and data files for variations of the GEOCARBSULFOR model (Krause et al., 2018) in MATLAB.

- GEOCARBSULFOR is the original model.

- GEOCARBSULFOR with GR arrays implements some updates to the code and data that Mills et al. (2019) applied to the original GEOCARBSULF model. 

- GEOCARBSULFOR Monte Carlo is a Monte Carlo approach which takes into account some uncertainties with the data.
