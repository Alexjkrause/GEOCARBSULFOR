# GEOCARBSULFOR
Code and data files for variations of the GEOCARBSULFOR model (Krause et al., 2018) in MATLAB.

GEOCARBSULFOR is the original model.

GEOCARBSULFOR with GR arrays uses the data and some variations to, for example, uplift, that were used in Mills et al. (2019).

GEOCARBSULFOR Monte Carlo is a Monte Carlo approach which takes into account some uncertainties with the data.
